# Project Title
Automated Deployment of Python Flask Application to AWS Using Terraform    

# Problem Statement
The development team at XYZ frequently updates their Python Flask application (app.py) and needs a quick, reliable method to deploy these changes to a test environment. Manually setting up the infrastructure each time the application is updated is time-consuming and error-prone. The team requires an automated solution to deploy their Flask application to an AWS environment that mimics production, ensuring a rapid, repeatable, and scalable deployment process.    

# Use of the Project
This project focuses on automating the deployment of a Python Flask application to AWS using Terraform. By leveraging Infrastructure as Code (IaC) practices, the project provides the following benefits:    

Reduced Setup Time: Automates the creation of an AWS environment, significantly cutting down the time required for infrastructure setup. 
Consistency: Ensures consistent configuration of the environment every time the application is deployed.       
Scalability: Easily scales to handle multiple deployments without additional manual effort.       
Error Reduction: Minimizes the risk of human error associated with manual infrastructure setup and deployment.        
Improved Developer Productivity: Allows developers to focus on coding and testing rather than managing infrastructure.       

# Steps to Create the Project

# 1. Define Requirements:  
AWS Resources: Identify the necessary AWS resources including VPC, public subnet, internet gateway, route table, EC2 instance, and security groups.     
Application Deployment: Specify deployment requirements such as deploying the app.py Flask application, installing dependencies, and exposing the application on port 80.        

# 2. Set Up Terraform Configuration:
Create VPC: Write Terraform scripts to create a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) with an appropriate CIDR block.      
Add Public Subnet: Add a public subnet within the VPC.   
Internet Gateway: Create and attach an internet gateway to the VPC.        
Configure Route Table: Set up a route table with a route to the internet gateway and associate it with the public subnet.       
Define EC2 Instance: Specify the configuration for the EC2 instance, including the AMI, instance type, and user data for bootstrapping.   
Security Group: Create a security group to allow HTTP traffic on port 80 and any other necessary ports (e.g., SSH on port 22). 

# 3. Deploy and Test the Infrastructure:
Deploy Infrastructure: Use Terraform to apply the configuration and provision the AWS resources. 
Deploy Application: 
Copy Application: Use Terraform’s file provisioner to transfer the app.py file (Flask application) to the EC2 instance.  
Install Dependencies: Use Terraform’s remote-exec provisioner to install Python, pip, Flask, and any other necessary libraries.    
Run Application: Set up a script or configuration to start the Flask application automatically upon instance setup. Ensure the application is set to run on port 80.   
Test Deployment: Verify that the Flask application is running correctly by accessing the public IP or DNS of the EC2 instance. Confirm that the application functions as expected by seeing the "Hello, World!" or equivalent message from Flask.   

# 4. Monitor and Maintain:
Monitoring: Implement basic monitoring to ensure the application is running smoothly. This could involve setting up logging within the Flask application or using AWS CloudWatch for instance metrics.  
Maintenance: Regularly update the Terraform configuration and any deployment scripts as needed to accommodate changes in the application or AWS environment.      

# Conclusion
This project demonstrates how to automate the deployment of a Python Flask application to AWS using Terraform. By automating both the infrastructure provisioning and application deployment processes, the project addresses the challenges of manual setup, reduces errors, and enhances deployment efficiency. This solution ensures a consistent, scalable, and reliable deployment process, enabling the development team to focus more on application development and testing rather than managing infrastructure.
