# Project Title
Automated Deployment of Python Application to AWS Using Terraform

# Problem Statement
The development team at XYZ frequently updates their Python application (app.py) and needs a quick, reliable method to deploy these changes to a test environment. Manually setting up the infrastructure each time the application is updated is time-consuming and error-prone. The team requires an automated solution to deploy their application to an AWS environment that mimics production, ensuring a rapid, repeatable, and scalable deployment process.

# Use of the Project
This project focuses on automating the deployment of a Python application to AWS using Terraform. By leveraging Infrastructure as Code (IaC) practices, the project provides the following benefits:

Reduced Setup Time: Automates the creation of an AWS environment, significantly cutting down the time required for infrastructure setup.            
Consistency: Ensures consistent configuration of the environment every time the application is deployed.                        
Scalability: Easily scales to handle multiple deployments without additional manual effort.                              
Error Reduction: Minimizes the risk of human error associated with manual infrastructure setup and deployment.                              
Improved Developer Productivity: Allows developers to focus on coding and testing rather than managing infrastructure.                                   

# Steps to Create the Project
# 1. Define Requirements:
AWS Resources: Identify the necessary AWS resources including VPC, public subnet, internet gateway, route table, EC2 instance, and security groups.                
Application Deployment: Specify deployment requirements such as deploying the app.py file, installing dependencies, and configuring the application.                  

# 2. Set Up Terraform Configuration:
Create VPC: Write Terraform scripts to create a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) with an appropriate CIDR block.           
Add Public Subnet: Add a public subnet within the VPC.                     
Internet Gateway: Create and attach an internet gateway to the VPC.                         
Configure Route Table: Set up a route table with a route to the internet gateway and associate it with the public subnet.              
Define EC2 Instance: Specify the configuration for the EC2 instance, including the AMI, instance type, and user data for bootstrapping.                  
Security Group: Create a security group to allow HTTP traffic on port 80 and any other necessary ports (e.g., SSH on port 22).                   

# 3. Deploy and Test the Infrastructure:
Deploy Infrastructure: Use Terraform to apply the configuration and provision the AWS resources.          
Deploy Application:           
Copy Application: Use Terraform’s file provisioner to transfer the app.py file to the EC2 instance.                 
Install Dependencies: Use Terraform’s remote-exec provisioner to install Python and any necessary libraries (e.g., pip).                   
Run Application: Set up a script to run the Python application automatically upon instance setup.                               
Test Deployment: Verify that the application is running correctly by accessing the public IP or DNS of the EC2 instance. Confirm that the application functions as expected.            

# 4. Monitor and Maintain:
Monitoring: Implement basic monitoring to ensure the application is running smoothly. This could involve setting up simple logging or using AWS CloudWatch for instance metrics.     
Maintenance: Regularly update the Terraform configuration and any deployment scripts as needed to address changes in the application or AWS environment.       

# Conclusion
This project demonstrates how to automate the deployment of a Python application to AWS using Terraform. By automating infrastructure provisioning and application deployment, the project addresses the challenges of manual setup, reduces errors, and enhances deployment efficiency. This solution ensures a consistent, scalable, and reliable deployment process, enabling the development team to focus more on application development and testing rather than managing infrastructure.
