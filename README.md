### Project Title

*"Automated Deployment of Python Flask Application to AWS using Terraform and CI/CD Pipeline"*

### Problem Statement

The development team at XYZ frequently updates their Python Flask application (app.py) and requires a quick and reliable method to test these changes in a live environment. Manually setting up the infrastructure each time they modify the application is time-consuming and prone to errors. The development team needs an automated solution to rapidly deploy their application to a test environment that mimics a production-like setup on AWS. This solution should be efficient, repeatable, and scalable to handle multiple deployments triggered by changes to the application code.

### Use of the Project

This project aims to automate the deployment of a Python Flask application to AWS using Terraform and a CI/CD pipeline. By leveraging infrastructure as code (IaC) and continuous integration/continuous deployment practices, the project provides the following benefits:
- *Reduced Setup Time:* Automates the creation of an AWS environment, significantly reducing the time required to set up infrastructure for testing purposes.
- *Consistency:* Ensures consistent environment configuration every time the application is deployed.
- *Scalability:* Easily scales to handle multiple developers and multiple projects without additional manual effort.
- *Error Reduction:* Minimizes the risk of human error associated with manual infrastructure setup and deployment.
- *Improved Developer Productivity:* Allows developers to focus on coding and testing rather than managing infrastructure, accelerating the development cycle.

### Steps to Create the Project

1. *Define Requirements:*
   - Identify the necessary AWS resources: VPC, public subnet, internet gateway, route table, EC2 instance, and security groups.
   - Specify application deployment requirements: deployment of the app.py file, installation of dependencies, and exposing the application on port 80.

2. *Set Up Terraform Configuration:*
   - Write Terraform scripts to create a VPC.
   - Add a public subnet within the VPC.
   - Create and attach an internet gateway to the VPC.
   - Configure a route table with a route to the internet gateway and associate it with the public subnet.
   - Define an EC2 instance with the necessary configuration (e.g., AMI, instance type, user data for bootstrapping).
   - Set up a security group to allow HTTP traffic on port 80.

3. *Deploy and Test the Infrastructure:*
   - Use Terraform to apply the configuration and deploy the infrastructure.
   - Deploy the app.py Flask application to the EC2 instance.
   - Test the deployed application using the provided public IP or DNS.

4. *Integrate CI/CD Pipeline:*
   - Set up a GitHub repository for the application code.
   - Configure a CI/CD tool (e.g., Jenkins or GitHub Actions) to monitor the repository for changes to app.py.
   - Automate the deployment process to trigger Terraform scripts whenever a change is detected.
   - Ensure the pipeline includes steps to pull the latest code, apply Terraform configurations, and deploy the application.

5. *Verify and Document the Solution:*
   - Test the entire pipeline to ensure the automated deployment works as expected.
   - Document the project setup, configurations, and usage instructions for future reference and for use by other team members.

6. *Optimize and Maintain:*
   - Review and optimize Terraform configurations for cost and performance efficiency.
   - Implement monitoring and logging for the deployed infrastructure and application to aid in troubleshooting and maintenance.
   - Update the CI/CD pipeline as needed to accommodate new requirements or changes in infrastructure.
